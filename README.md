To run the development build with the webpack-dev-server run `npm start` then navigate to `localhost:3000 `.  
To build the project run `npm run build` the project will be built to the `build` folder.  
Then you may deploy it in any way you see fit.  
For example you can use serve:  
  `npm install -g serve`  
  `serve -s build`

Enjoy!
